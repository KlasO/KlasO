### Hi there! 

- 🔭 I’m mostly working on things related to old Atari 8 bit computers. My day job is project management (nowadays mostly as scrum master).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. I've known a bit about BASIC and 6502 assembly for a long time, and I am keen to add more modern skills as well (Python, C#, Javascript).
