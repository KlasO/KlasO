### Hi there! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on different software and hardware things, some (or many) related to old Atari 8 bit computers. My day job is project management, currently as scrum master.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning how to improve my coding skills. I have no formal training as a programmer, although I've known a bit about BASIC and 6502 assembly for a long time, and I am keen to add more modern skills as well (Python, C#, Javascript).
